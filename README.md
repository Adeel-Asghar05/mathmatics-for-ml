📘 Mathematics for AI, ML, Deep Learning & DRL

This repository is dedicated to my personal learning journey in the mathematical foundations required for:

✅ Artificial Intelligence (AI)

✅ Machine Learning (ML)

✅ Deep Learning (DL)

✅ Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)

My goal is to build strong intuition and practical understanding of the math concepts used in these fields.

🎯 Objectives

Understand core math concepts used in AI/ML.

Build intuition for DL and DRL algorithms.

Practice implementing math in code (Python, NumPy, PyTorch).

Create notes, visualizations, and examples for lifelong reference.
